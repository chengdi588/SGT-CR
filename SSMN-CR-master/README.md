# SSMN-CR
Linear censored regression models with skew scale mixtures of normal distributions; 
Authors: Daniel C. F. Guzm\án, Clécio S. Ferreira and Camila B. Zeller

In this paper, we propose to examine the censorship problem in context of the class of asymmetric, i.e., we have proposed a linear 
regression model with censored responses based on skew scale mixtures of normal distributions (SSMN). We develop a Monte Carlo EM 
(MCEM) algorithm to perform maximum likelihood inference of the parameters in the proposed linear censored regression models with 
SSMN distributions. The MCEM algorithm has been discussed with an emphasis on the skew-normal, skew Student-t-normal, skew-slash 
and skew-contaminated normal distributions. 

The file Applications.R allows simulate and to fit SSMN-CR to real data.
